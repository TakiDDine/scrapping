This time estimation is approximate and can vary based on the complexity of your specific requirements. Additionally, it does not include ongoing maintenance, updates, or scaling considerations, which you should plan for as well.

Remember that security is crucial when dealing with sensitive data like charitable aid orders, so ensure that your application follows best practices for data protection and user privacy. Furthermore, you may need to adjust the time estimation based on your team's familiarity with Laravel and SMS integration services.
